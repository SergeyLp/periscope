1
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:02,731
What do you want from him?

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,135
I don't want to lose this.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,239
- Do you love him?
- I'm fond of him.

4
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,043
Why won't you return my calls?

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,313
<i>What does she have
that I don't have?</i>

6
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,351
- She's a shop girl.
- We'll talk about it later.

7
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,522
How many times you think
you can knock over

8
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,593
<i>Nucky Thompson's bagman
before he bites back?</i>

9
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,095
You been to Lolly Steinman's?

10
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,400
<i>End of a Saturday they got
150 grand in the cage.</i>

11
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,538
May I present
senator Walter edge

12
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:27,376
<i>and the honorable Frank Hague,
Mayor of Jersey City.</i>

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,778
I want the highway.

14
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,948
You're putting a big bet
on Walter edge.

15
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:34,087
I wouldn't. He's a silent
partner in a paving company.

16
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,159
- Where? - Jersey City,
where your roads aren't.

17
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:40,532
Nucky Thompson didn't get
where he is by being naive.

18
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,301
He could stop giving me money.

19
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,804
What about Jimmy?

20
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,641
I would have thought
he'd send something...

21
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,677
if not for me, for Tommy.

22
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,147
He's a genius, this kid.

23
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:52,017
They'd come
after us eventually.

24
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,621
Us? So you're
sticking around.

25
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,695
I could use a dozen like you.

26
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,099
The world series was
months ago, lawyer Fallon.

27
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:04,036
And the horse shit
hasn't dried yet.

28
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,206
Do you have children
of your own, Mr. Thompson?

29
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,043
I do not.

30
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:10,480
Go home, Nelson.
Visit your wife.

31
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:11,949
<i>That's an order.</i>

32
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:13,818
The whole thing's
a game, isn't it?

33
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:17,524
So easy for you.
Well, I'll keep at it.

34
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,293
Maybe one day
I'll lie as good as you.

35
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,864
It's lie as well as me,
you dolt.

36
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,802
Want to be taken seriously?
Then learn how to speak.

37
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:40,647
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

38
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:50,014
Well, who was it?

39
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:53,317
Fella got off on the wrong floor.
He was drunk.

40
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:56,053
The general motors convention.

41
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,956
That's it?
There's nobody else out there?

42
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,861
That waiting room's packed
when Nucky's in town.

43
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:08,699
I don't get it. It's not like
the city's closed for business.

44
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,701
When he's away, I'm in charge.
What's so complicated?

45
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:15,071
People are funny...
creatures of habit.

46
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:18,040
They need a favor, they know
Nucky's the man to see.

47
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,612
Get me some coffee.

48
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,153
You don't think
I can do what he does?

49
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,287
The glad-handing,
the backslapping?

50
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,722
I'll buy a nickel joke book
down at the five and dime,

51
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,191
I'll be the toast
of the town myself.

52
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:46,833
- Oh.
- Oh what?

53
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:50,170
I forgot!
Nuck's in Chicago.

54
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,172
And I'm here,
so what do you want?

55
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,245
This Friday

56
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,915
my daughter's being
fitted for her leg braces.

57
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,117
I-I was hoping
to take the day,

58
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,419
have someone else
make my collections.

59
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,488
- Who usually fills in?
- Neary,

60
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,657
but with the indictment,

61
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,525
<i>I got his route now too.</i>

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,194
Your kid has polio?

63
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:19,399
Take the day off.
Be with your girl.

64
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,434
Are you sure?

65
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,403
I just said it, didn't I?
Why would I not be sure?

66
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,539
Thanks.

67
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,450
- Good day, sir.
- Here you go.

68
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,952
Thank you, sir.

69
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:43,422
My wire specifically requested
the presidential suite.

70
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:46,359
I'm sorry, sir.
General Wood has also made that request.

71
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,862
- He's jumping the gun a
bit, isn't he? - Sir?

72
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,631
<i>General Wood is only
a candidate for president.</i>

73
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,266
Oh yes, of course.

74
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,302
The ambassador suite is
quite lovely as well, sir.

75
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,036
Fine, then give Wood
the ambassador

76
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,638
- and bring my bags up to the
presidential suite. - Sir, I...

77
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,373
let me tell you the difference
between me and Gerald Wood.

78
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:06,176
He is a war hero,
former army chief of staff

79
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,547
and practically a shoo-in for the
republican presidential nomination.

80
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,549
I, on the other hand,
am a magnificent tipper.

81
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:15,918
I'd like a bucket of ice
and three bottles

82
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,087
of Canadian club
waiting in the parlor.

83
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:22,892
Please make yourself comfortable
while we prepare the suite.

84
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,970
All this empty space, I wonder
where they hide the hootch.

85
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,746
Well, if it isn't
Marley's ghost.

86
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,149
Senator edge, whatever
brings you to Chicago?

87
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:52,018
Oh, I don't know.

88
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,787
I heard the Republicans were
throwing a little shindig,

89
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:58,123
- thought I'd drop by. - Grab the V.P.
nod while you're here?

90
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,960
I hadn't actually
considered that,

91
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,195
but now that you mention it...

92
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:08,367
How are you, Nuck?
Well, I can't complain,

93
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:10,235
but that doesn't mean I won't.

94
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,471
I'm wondering if you'd
do me a favor.

95
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:16,875
Harry Daugherty's hosting a reception
tonight, he asked me to drop by.

96
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,211
Warren Harding's
campaign manager?

97
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:21,980
- Who cares about harding?
- Well, nobody,

98
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,316
but Daugherty's
a good man to know.

99
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,953
If you'd go on my behalf?
I have a pressing engagement.

100
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,255
Well, don't press on her
too hard, Walter.

101
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,492
You know me well, my friend.

102
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,795
I do indeed.

103
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,666
We're gonna take
this thing, Nucky.

104
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,670
And as soon as we do,
the sky's the limit.

105
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,839
The sky?
I'm only interested

106
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:50,341
in the roads,
Mr. vice president.

107
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:55,780
- So you'll see Daugherty?
- You know me... I'll see 'em all.

108
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,549
You're a real pal, Nuck.

109
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,619
- Gentlemen.
- Ah!

110
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:04,021
The senator seems
in a good humor.

111
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,457
Go check on the room.

112
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:18,636
- Peridot.
- Is that what it's called?

113
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,471
Not emeralds, but not nothing.

114
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:22,106
Do you think he
picked it himself?

115
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,742
I don't know.

116
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:28,278
Either he's got better taste in women's
jewelry than a red-blooded man should,

117
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:31,983
- or someone's doing his shopping for him.
- Mr. Kessler, perhaps.

118
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,852
- The little bochey fellow?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:36,421
What's he got hidden
under his woolens?

120
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,890
The kaiser's mustache.

121
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,027
You are a terrible influence.

122
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,430
How is your Harry?

123
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,132
My Harry's fine.
How's yours?

124
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,635
We should
get some more cream cakes.

125
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,738
Oh, why not? We can bring
them back for the children.

126
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:58,243
- Not so bad sometimes, is it?
- What?

127
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:01,212
The whole ball of wax.

128
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,950
- Margaret.
- Madame Jeunet.

129
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:08,787
Oh, you must assist me.

130
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:12,724
- In what?
- Where'd you go?!

131
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:14,859
Ahhh.

132
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:17,628
Everybody knows
everybody, isn't that swell?

133
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:20,932
- How's tricks, Lucy?
- Don't act like you care.

134
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:23,901
She wishes to make a large
purchase, but her credit...

135
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:26,137
Mr. Thompson has made clear
that he no longer...

136
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:29,006
What are you two
whispering about?

137
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,442
Americans don't whisper.

138
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,311
I have asked Margaret
to help me to explain...

139
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:36,814
Oh, she'll help.
She's very helpful.

140
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:39,082
Aren't you,
Mrs. MacDougal?

141
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:43,586
- Schroeder.
- Is that Irish for "bitch"?

142
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,757
You're not at your best now
and you should leave.

143
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,160
Oh, you're in charge
of the lobby now too?

144
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:53,963
- Lucy.
- My old friend Annabelle.

145
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:57,034
You wouldn't steer
me wrong, would you?

146
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:00,805
- No, I wouldn't.
- You're about as phony as that wig.

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,442
Miss Danziger,
you must stop now.

148
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,377
You think that
he's your friend?

149
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:08,314
You think you understand him?

150
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,583
And what if I did?

151
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:13,352
Then you're the dumbest Dora
I ever met.

152
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,761
The next time won't be
nearly as pleasant.

153
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,181
What do you think?

154
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,883
She looks pretty.

155
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:54,850
The grocery bill...
it's overdue.

156
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,853
<i>- How much is it?
- Nearly $11, dear.</i>

157
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:01,691
Hello, Tommy.

158
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,325
Did you check the box?

159
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,394
I saw the postman as well.

160
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,297
There was nothing else.

161
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,307
Perhaps it's time
you get a job.

162
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:21,944
My friend Mary
said the same thing.

163
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,980
Have you considered
selling little dot?

164
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:28,417
- I'm not sure what that is.
- It's a perfume company.

165
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,853
The ladies who go door to door?

166
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:33,822
Some of their fragrances
are really quite lovely.

167
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:37,226
The Violet, Lily of the valley.

168
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,061
I don't think it's for me.

169
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,396
That's right,

170
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,899
you bohemian types
go au naturel.

171
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,869
I've worn perfume.

172
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,872
I was talking about the job.

173
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,744
There's an art dealer
in New York...

174
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:58,046
Greenwich village...

175
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:01,249
and he's agreed
to look at my work

176
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,485
<i>with an eye
toward selling it.</i>

177
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,921
- Oh really?
- There are no guarantees, of course.

178
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:10,358
- But Mary...
- Your friend.

179
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:14,729
Yes.

180
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:17,398
She thinks I have
a good chance.

181
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,603
You could take a stenography
course as well, you know.

182
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:32,613
- Sir?
- Yes?

183
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,782
We got another one.

184
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,785
I haven't confirmed it yet,

185
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,354
but word on the street
is the D.A.

186
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,723
is sniffing around
some of the white sox.

187
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,595
Then he'd be wise to put
a clothespin on his nose.

188
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,832
Any idea which players?

189
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,437
Cicotte and Jackson,
near as I can tell.

190
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,906
Get the farm boys to spill
their milk, is that the idea?

191
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,177
Fallon & McGee.
How may I help you?

192
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:41,514
It doesn't matter what they
say if Attell won't talk.

193
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,484
Will he?

194
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,257
He's already been
flapping his gums.

195
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,194
And if the D.A.
pulls him in?

196
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,463
He may be able to take a punch,

197
00:13:57,497 --> 00:14:01,599
but put him in a witness chair and Abe
Attell will fold like hot laundry.

198
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,537
Give it to me again.

199
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:09,706
"Baseball is
the heart of America.

200
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,876
As a patriot,
I would never do anything

201
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,112
- to degrade our..."
- Besmirch.

202
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,016
It's better.

203
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,820
"... To 'besmirch'
our national pastime.

204
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
this entire ugly affair

205
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:32,163
began when Abe Attell
and some other cheap gamblers

206
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,599
approached me to fix
the world series,

207
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,101
a sordid scheme which
every newsboy on Broadway

208
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:39,770
knows I turned down flat.

209
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,939
And not only was I
not in on the deal,

210
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:44,942
I furthermore did not bet
one red cent on the series

211
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,811
after I found out
what was underway."

212
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,416
<i>Isn't it true, sir, that a man named
sport Sullivan approached you as well?</i>

213
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,692
"I'm approached
by people every day

214
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,128
with all manner
of harebrained schemes.

215
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,263
Certainly suffering fools

216
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,599
can't be illegal."

217
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,371
You know it's not too late
to go to law school, Arnold.

218
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,611
I prefer to make
my living honestly.

219
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,917
- Never get close to a majority.
- Absolutely.

220
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,553
And with Coolidge on the
ticket, I think he has...

221
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,122
- Sir?
- Nucky Thompson.

222
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,191
I'm looking
for Harry Daugherty.

223
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,126
<i>Right over there.</i>

224
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,263
Mr. Thompson.

225
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,864
Harry Daugherty.

226
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,666
- Call me Nucky.
- Nucky it is.

227
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,001
- What can I get you?
- I wouldn't say no to a bourbon.

228
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,470
Two double
bourbons on the double.

229
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,639
Say that 10 times fast.

230
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,607
Senator edge sends his regrets.

231
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,609
Well, he'll certainly
be missed,

232
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,745
but those in the know say
you're the man to see.

233
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,545
I suppose that depends
on what you want.

234
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,213
"As Nucky Thompson goes,

235
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,583
so goes the New Jersey
delegation."

236
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:57,318
Well, is it true?

237
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,887
We'll have to wait
and see, now won't we?

238
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,889
That's why
I wanted to meet you.

239
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:05,492
See, I think Warren harding
could go all the way.

240
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,262
<i>Put edge on that ticket
and we've got a winner.</i>

241
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:11,132
I like a long shot as much
as the next fella, Harry,

242
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,401
but I'm not quite sure
how you're doping that out.

243
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,770
The front runner's are
Wood and Lowden, right?

244
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:18,640
That senate inquiry is
a black mark on 'em both.

245
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,675
- The campaign finance.
- Then there's Johnson,

246
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,010
who started the damn
investigation to begin with,

247
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,912
which didn't exactly
win him any friends.

248
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:28,750
The field has no first-raters and
Harding's the best of the second-raters.

249
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:32,653
Not exactly a rousing endorsement,
but it happens to be true.

250
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,455
<i>He certainly
looks like a president.</i>

251
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,657
That's half the battle,
my friend.

252
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,059
More than half if those
trollops get the vote.

253
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:41,595
- Great meal last night, Harry.
- Do the right thing, boys,

254
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,432
- and steak won't be the only thing on the menu.
- You bet, Harry.

255
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:48,735
I have quite an appetite
myself, you know?

256
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,406
You should meet Warren.
You're gonna like him.

257
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:02,816
Mr. Smith... he invited me.

258
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,752
- My name should be on the list.
- Miss Britton, go to your room.

259
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:09,088
- I'll make sure he knows... - Jess, would
you please just tell Warren that I'm here.

260
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:12,291
Senator and Mrs. harding, I'd
like you to meet Nucky Thompson,

261
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,627
an esteemed member of
the New Jersey delegation.

262
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,696
- How do you do?
- An honor and a privilege.

263
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,165
Senator, I read a speech
you gave back in may

264
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,866
in Rhode island, I believe.

265
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:23,702
- "Back to normal.
" - Boston, at the home market club.

266
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,937
- Right.
- It was quite something.

267
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,739
- Very well done.
- That's nothing.

268
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,875
I can spend hours bloviating.

269
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,511
You see, Americans don't want

270
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,547
someone looking
to stir things up.

271
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,782
They want stability,
someone dedicated

272
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,851
to safeguarding
America first...

273
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,921
<i>...To prosper America
first, to think of America first.</i>

274
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:46,457
My best judgment for
what America needs now

275
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:49,026
is to steady down, to get
squarely on our feet...

276
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,796
Warren, there's a few other
gentlemen I'd like you to meet.

277
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,832
Nucky, I hope you'll
consider what we discussed.

278
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,467
A pleasure.

279
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,240
You must be awfully
proud of your husband.

280
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,876
It's a terrible wretched thing.

281
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,147
A fortune-teller told me
he'll die in office.

282
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:18,123
Thank you, miss Britton.

283
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:41,214
- Evening.
- Good evening.

284
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,651
- Beautiful child.
- Oh, thank you.

285
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,120
A young republican,
I'm guessing.

286
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,022
She certainly is.

287
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:53,024
- And what brings you to
the convention? - Oh...

288
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,461
We're, um, friends
of Mr. Harding's.

289
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,631
Well, it's good to have
friends in politics.

290
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:06,136
Do you have children yourself?

291
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,339
No.

292
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:11,741
I had a son.

293
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,643
He died.

294
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,579
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:34,296
Bless this food, o lord,

296
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,633
and ourselves
to thy loving service;

297
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,636
That we may always
continue in thy faith

298
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,739
and fear to the honor
and glory of thy name,

299
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:47,275
through Jesus Christ our lord.

300
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,346
- Amen.
- Amen.

301
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,055
The garden...

302
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:59,858
The tulips are looking
a little ragged.

303
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,831
What's wrong?

304
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:14,871
You put yourself
through this every month.

305
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:20,544
It means I'm not fully a woman.

306
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,379
<i>- Yes, you are, very much so.
- No.</i>

307
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:26,116
No. No baby
will grow inside me.

308
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,220
And in the place of that joy,

309
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:33,423
every 28 days the blood flows

310
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,458
<i>and then I can't help it,
so do the tears.</i>

311
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,193
Please eat.

312
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:58,815
I, uh, ran into Naomi
Ellsworth at the milliner.

313
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,583
Mmm.

314
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,353
She said I might be able
to get some help.

315
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,756
Must everyone know
our private affairs?

316
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,059
She had difficulty
conceiving herself.

317
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,494
There was a... a blockage
in her tubes as well.

318
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,597
Why must we always
go on about this?

319
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,265
If the lord wanted us...

320
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,200
if the lord wanted us
to die of appendicitis

321
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,371
then he wouldn't have given
us the ability to treat it.

322
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,879
That's Naomi Ellsworth talking.

323
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,848
I want to get this fixed.

324
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:37,120
There's a physician in Manhattan.

325
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:40,223
- He can perform a surgery.
- Surgery?!

326
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,358
It's $270.

327
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,762
My salary barely meets
expenses as it is.

328
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,900
I want to give you
a son, Nelson.

329
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:10,620
All I want is for you
to be happy, rose.

330
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,958
I'll do what I can.

331
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,797
Now please, dear, eat.

332
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,108
<i>- She knows what she wants!
- Cover your eyes.</i>

333
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:37,243
<i>You're too good.</i>

334
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,111
<i>- Get in there!
- Here we go.</i>

335
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:41,481
<i>- Look at that.
- I'll tell you,</i>

336
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:44,951
if they had nuns like that, I might
have made it past sixth grade.

337
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:47,388
I don't think anything could have
got you past the sixth grade, Jim.

338
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,089
<i>What's this now?</i>

339
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,059
<i>- Oh boy.
- It's called a snatch, Al.</i>

340
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:53,494
What's that smell like
on a hot summer day?

341
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:57,265
Jesus, where do they
get these women?

342
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,802
If I find out, I'm sure as
hell keeping it to myself.

343
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,938
- Ah. Sorry, boys.
- God damn it.

344
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,441
- Come on!
- It was just getting good.

345
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,443
<i>- There we go.
- Back in business.</i>

346
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:11,480
<i>- All right! - So are we all
straight on the collections?</i>

347
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:13,649
Yeah, I'll take the inlet
to Maryland Avenue,

348
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,484
Fleming will take
the other side.

349
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:18,654
♪ I'll be in Scotland
before ye! ♪

350
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,756
How about the casino?

351
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,025
- I'll take that myself.
- Are you sure?

352
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,326
Yeah.

353
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,961
June and I have an affair...

354
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,363
her cousin's wedding.
I'll swing by on the way home.

355
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:31,032
<i>Sister Mary Catherine!</i>

356
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,802
<i>- Uh-oh, bad girl!
- Oh yeah.</i>

357
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:37,672
Fellas, I think I'm
joining the priesthood.

358
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,711
<i>Come on, what's
going on back there, Boyd?</i>

359
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:45,847
<i>Oh!</i>

360
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,482
- Jesus Christ!
- What the...

361
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:54,221
<i>- Boyd, nice work.
- To too hot to watch.</i>

362
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,390
Good job, Boyd!

363
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,525
- Oh shit.
- Good thinking.

364
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,531
Ho, what you doing?

365
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,700
These are friends of mine.

366
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:44,203
Convenient you waited
till he was done.

367
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:47,372
Standard operating procedure.
It's a new world.

368
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:50,242
If he could talk, I'm sure
Charlie Sheridan would agree.

369
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:51,843
You read about that, huh?

370
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:54,446
Your boy Jimmy?
My boy.

371
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,982
Two rums, Tommy!
Oh...

372
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,284
wait, that's right...
we ain't got any.

373
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:02,220
You just can't make
your point, huh?

374
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:04,389
Well, where the fuck
is it already?

375
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,992
McCoy's sailing up
from Bimini as we speak.

376
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:09,127
On a raft?
I need delivery.

377
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:12,263
These broads are over the moon with
this Mary Pickford cocktail.

378
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,065
They mix the rum
with grenadine.

379
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,068
'Cause the bootleg stuff
tastes like shit.

380
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,438
So you're making a show
at the convention, eh?

381
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:24,375
<i>It's so nice
to meet your acquaintance.</i>

382
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:26,678
I'm a politician.

383
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:29,247
There are some things
you can't buy in a cathouse.

384
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:31,916
Salut.

385
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:39,123
So let me ask you, any scuttlebutt
on this Harry Daugherty?

386
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:42,426
- Never heard of him.
- He's Warren Harding's campaign manager.

387
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,662
- Never heard of him neither.
- He's a senator from Ohio.

388
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:47,164
- He's running for president.
- Why didn't you say so?

389
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,101
Ohio? You should
talk to judge graves.

390
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:53,103
- Who's he? - See?
You don't know everybody.

391
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,772
Your honor!

392
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,011
I want to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine...

393
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,113
<i>Nucky Thompson
from Atlantic City.</i>

394
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,349
- How do you do?
- Oh, I've never been to Jersey.

395
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:08,018
Staten island once,
but that was years ago.

396
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:10,687
Well, you're welcome any time.
At my expense, of course.

397
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:13,557
- Much obliged.
- Here.

398
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:20,864
So I hear you have some
insight into Warren harding.

399
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:24,601
Harding? He's a puppet for the
fast-money boys in Cleveland.

400
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:27,103
I used to sit
on the bench there.

401
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:30,440
- You like his chances? - I like them
better with Harry Daugherty behind him.

402
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:33,310
- A little cagey, that one.
- But he knows how to treat a friend,

403
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,445
I can tell you that
from experience.

404
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:38,515
These Ohio fellas know what
they're doing, Mr. Thompson.

405
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,617
Five presidents
since the civil war.

406
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:42,318
JudgeGraves?

407
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,854
Belle's arrived.

408
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,792
Gentlemen.
I never keep a lady waiting.

409
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:52,729
<i>- A pleasure.
- Enjoy.</i>

410
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:56,799
Loves his dark meat, this one.

411
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,669
Gotta bring her in special
from the black belt.

412
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,004
Go, get out of here, go!

413
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,207
<i>- You think it's funny? Tough guy, move it.
- I gotta take my money.</i>

414
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:07,410
- Move it! Piece of shit.
- Let go of me.

415
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,880
The lady says stop,
that's what it means.

416
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:14,983
If I see you here again, I'll
cut your fucking pecker off.

417
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:17,019
- Get him outta here.
- Move it.

418
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:29,097
Nucky.

419
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:31,199
James.

420
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,872
- Is everything all right?
- Why wouldn't it be?

421
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,341
What are you doing here?

422
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,210
I've been coming to Chicago
since before you were born.

423
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,346
Who do you think lit that fire?

424
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:47,248
You're looking well.

425
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,384
New suit.

426
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,189
Mr. Torrio's been
very helpful.

427
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:59,261
<i>Call us a cab, Eddie.</i>

428
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,298
Excuse me.

429
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,369
If you want, I could
give you fellas a lift.

430
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,474
Old times, eh?

431
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,176
Sure, why not?

432
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:17,880
Somehow, James, we've all been
managing to get along without you.

433
00:28:17,914 --> 00:28:20,049
Your family as well.

434
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:25,154
- How are they?
- Why don't you call and find out?

435
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:28,257
I write her every week, Nuck.
She never writes me back.

436
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,193
Next time you buy
a new wristwatch for yourself?

437
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,430
Don't.
Send them the money instead.

438
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,260
Lolly?

439
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,130
Hello!

440
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,310
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,012
The fuck's going on here?

442
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:26,814
Don't fucking move!

443
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:33,554
Get the bag!

444
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,424
You follow us...

445
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:40,194
... We'll kill youse all!

446
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:21,601
I'll tell you, as much as they
crow about their meat here,

447
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:24,771
for my money it's
the occidental in D.C.

448
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:29,142
<i>Your money? When's the last
time you paid for a dinner?</i>

449
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:31,644
Mmm, right after
McKinley was elected.

450
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:41,120
How bad?

451
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,428
- Excuse me, Walter.
- Everything okay?

452
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:52,130
I need a telephone.

453
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:16,754
- Hello?
- It's me.

454
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,257
<i>What time is it?</i>

455
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,659
I don't know, late.

456
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,428
<i>Are you all right?</i>

457
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:26,364
No. Margaret,
there's been an incident.

458
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:28,866
My brother's been shot.

459
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:31,703
Oh my God, is he dead?

460
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,705
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

461
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:37,075
<i>- I need you to do something for me.
- I'll go to him immediately.</i>

462
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:39,344
Uh, but I'll need
to call a sitter.

463
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:41,145
No. Actually,
it's my office.

464
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,114
<i>Yes?</i>

465
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,983
Eli's being cared for.
He's home with his family.

466
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,952
There's a doctor.

467
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,687
I need you to go to the Ritz.

468
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,491
<i>- Very well. - My office...
it's been left unattended.</i>

469
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,627
<i>I'll need you to safeguard
a few things,</i>

470
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:58,762
<i>some business records.</i>

471
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,166
What about Mr. Fleming

472
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,834
<i>or one of your aldermen?</i>

473
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,602
I don't know what's
happening right now

474
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:09,339
and until I return I prefer
to rely only on you.

475
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:11,275
Can I do that?

476
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:12,943
Yes.

477
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:15,245
Yes, of course.

478
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,982
<i>In the top drawer of my desk
is a ledger book.</i>

479
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:22,552
I want you to take it out, leave it
closed and bring it to my closet.

480
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,989
In the back, behind the shoe
rack, is a compartment.

481
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:30,560
Slip it in there and stay in the suite
with your children until I return.

482
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:33,697
When will that be?

483
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:36,333
<i>I'm on the first
train home tomorrow.</i>

484
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,904
Are you all right?

485
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,043
I don't know.

486
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,406
What are you drinking?

487
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:20,409
Whiskey.

488
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:23,112
I figured only champagne
now with that get-up.

489
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:28,184
It's bespoke.

490
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:30,887
Al bought it for me.

491
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:34,523
Who's your friend?

492
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:36,825
War buddy.

493
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:41,563
Richard harrow.

494
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,900
To the lost.

495
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,709
So I'm assuming
this is not a social call.

496
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,646
I need you to come home, James.

497
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:00,449
Need or want?

498
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:03,919
Eli's been shot.
They robbed Lolly's.

499
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,055
- Who did?
- I don't know.

500
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,090
We're at war, kid.

501
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,693
They hit Chalky's
a few months back,

502
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,261
killed one of his men,

503
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,864
robbed O'Neill right out
in the open on the boards.

504
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:17,399
- And now this?
- Someone's got it in their head

505
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:21,170
that I'm weak, that I have no
real means of retaliation.

506
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:24,006
You got the whole sheriff's
department on your payroll.

507
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,341
And the sheriff in bed
with a bullet in his gut.

508
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:30,312
There are things I may require that I'm
uncomfortable asking of Eli anyway,

509
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:32,748
particularly with
the election coming.

510
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:42,624
This afternoon when you saw me,

511
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,861
you looked at me like I was something
you scraped off your boot.

512
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:48,430
Now it's 4:00 in the morning,
the world's closing in,

513
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:51,667
- I'm your long lost son?
- Don't overestimate yourself, James.

514
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:54,870
Why shouldn't I, Nuck?
I'm doing very well here.

515
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:56,872
And how far will that go?

516
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:58,807
You're Irish, Torrio's Italian.

517
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,976
You'll always be an outsider.

518
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,849
You know this suit
cost 70 bucks?

519
00:35:09,886 --> 00:35:12,954
You're about as subtle as a kick
in the teeth, you know that?

520
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:23,331
5% of anything
that comes in by boat

521
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:26,701
and 10% of anything
that comes in on wheels.

522
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:29,003
And that fed?

523
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,773
What do I do about him?

524
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:34,542
I'll work that out.

525
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:39,246
I got to think about it.

526
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:45,920
You do that,

527
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,788
but whatever you decide,

528
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:50,324
don't ever keep me
waiting again.

529
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:28,420
Hello?

530
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:34,426
Hello.

531
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,529
This is Mrs. Schroeder.

532
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:40,198
Who is this?

533
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:01,853
Well.
This is rather clandestine.

534
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:04,556
Something tells me you're no
stranger to backroom meetings.

535
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,958
Quite a back room.

536
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:09,494
I need to head home.
Something came up.

537
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:11,762
Before the convention
even starts?

538
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:13,431
I've made inquiries, Harry.

539
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,499
Heard good things about
you from judge graves.

540
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,434
You mean you heard I play ball.

541
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,603
Well, don't you?

542
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:22,206
The babe's got nothing
on Harry Daugherty.

543
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,174
I've thought about
what you said.

544
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,110
It's slim, but harding
has a chance.

545
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:28,078
I thought
you were backing Wood.

546
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:30,013
I think he'll
deadlock with Lowden.

547
00:38:30,048 --> 00:38:33,083
- And if that happens, they're both done.
- Delegates won't cross over.

548
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:36,653
Don't expect harding to be nominated early,
but come the fifth or sixth ballot?

549
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:40,223
Those bleary-eyed delegates will want to
nominate somebody who could actually win.

550
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:42,192
If that happens,
I'm prepared to throw

551
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:44,060
the Jersey delegation
behind harding.

552
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:45,761
In exchange for edge
getting v.P.

553
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:49,198
<i>In exchange for edge
not getting v.P.</i>

554
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:52,535
What am I missing here?

555
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,904
That Walter edge is a dirty
backstabbing chiseler

556
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:56,906
who gave my road money
to Frank Hague.

557
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,374
How do you know that?

558
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:01,210
Because Hague's an even
bigger backstabbing chiseler,

559
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:03,512
not to mention a friend.

560
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:07,583
That's rich, boy.
I'll tell ya.

561
00:39:07,617 --> 00:39:09,919
You can tell me something
else while you're at it.

562
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,488
Like how you propose to take
care of Harding's lady trouble.

563
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:15,191
Which lady?
Which trouble?

564
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,860
- There are more than one?
- Showgirls, shopgirls,

565
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:20,296
I've lost count,
to tell you the truth.

566
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:22,598
One of them's even
blackmailing him.

567
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,701
The skirt with the little girl?

568
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:27,036
Naw, she's okay.
She's in love is all.

569
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,872
- Name's Nan Britton.
- And the baby's his?

570
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,042
It could cost him the election.

571
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,779
Then let me help.
I'll bring her to a.C.,

572
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,016
put her up till November.
I've got a lady-friend with kids of her own,

573
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,486
they'll look in on her.
After the election, she's your problem again.

574
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,288
And then I get my road money.

575
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:50,059
I'll have to sell it to Warren.

576
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:52,661
I'm sure you're quite
the salesman.

577
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:59,001
You know Al Jolson agreed
to write his campaign song.

578
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:01,103
Eddie cantor's better.

579
00:40:08,312 --> 00:40:10,747
Love to hear from you.

580
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,015
I'm just surprised, that's all.

581
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:15,384
What, a fella can't call
his mother once in a while?

582
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:18,387
<i>You can call me
twice a day if you like.</i>

583
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:23,125
I saw Nucky.
He was o here for the convention.

584
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,928
I'm assuming you've heard
what happened to his brother.

585
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:28,263
Yeah, that was something, huh?

586
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:32,134
<i>I swear, this world is going
to hell in a handbasket.</i>

587
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:35,370
Yeah.

588
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,475
You sound lonesome, baby.

589
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,013
I was thinking of you.

590
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,848
<i>Are you eating?</i>

591
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,284
Yeah, of course.

592
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:52,821
Why don't you come home,
honeypot?

593
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:56,658
I don't know.

594
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,533
So what can you tell me
about this Luciano fella?

595
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,702
Well...

596
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:09,771
Where do I begin?

597
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:14,543
Yeah, those two.
This way, miss Britton.

598
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,518
Nucky!

599
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:26,823
I got your message.
Where are you going?

600
00:41:26,857 --> 00:41:29,892
- Home. - But the delegates
haven't voted yet.

601
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:31,994
Who's gonna get
all our ducks in a row?

602
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:34,629
- Why don't you ask Frank Hague?
- Hague?

603
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:36,797
What's this all about?

604
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:40,001
We've known each other a long time,
Wally, so why don't you cut the crap?

605
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,703
"Wally"?

606
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:45,006
You're speaking to a
United States senator.

607
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,574
And that's all you'll ever be.

608
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:48,943
You made a deal with Hague
to fuck me over.

609
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:52,413
- Nucky, I have no idea what you're
talking about... - Don't insult me.

610
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:58,119
It was just politics.

611
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:00,254
I'll make it up to you later.

612
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:02,423
Later when?

613
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:04,391
When I'm in the white house.

614
00:42:04,426 --> 00:42:07,895
Senator, the only chance you
have of entering the white house

615
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,931
is on a guided fucking tour.

616
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,710
"I love your back,
I love your breasts,

617
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:10,712
daring to feel
where my face rests.

618
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:14,216
I love your skin
so soft and white,

619
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,921
so dear to feel
and sweet to bite.

620
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:22,324
<i>I love your knees,
their dimples kiss.</i>

621
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,793
I lo your ways of giving bliss.

622
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,963
I love your poise
of perfect thighs,

623
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,700
the way they hold me
in paradise."

624
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:36,004
That was the first love
poem Warren ever wrote me.

625
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,374
He's got quite
a way with words.

626
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,147
We'll be making a coal stop
in 30 minutes, folks.

627
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,316
I'm going to freshen up.

628
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:52,754
<i>- Anything out of Chicago?
- Just came over the wires.</i>

629
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:55,957
Warren harding received the
nomination after 10 ballots.

630
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:02,430
That imbecile

631
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:05,433
is going to be the next
President of the United States.

632
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:50,543
"My dearest rose,

633
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:54,113
<i>like Sarah, Rebecca
and Hannah before you,</i>

634
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:57,884
<i>I urge you to trust
in God's plan,</i>

635
00:45:57,918 --> 00:45:59,719
<i>not just for your own sake,</i>

636
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:01,587
<i>but also the sake
of any offspring</i>

637
00:46:01,622 --> 00:46:04,690
<i>he may see fit
to bestow upon us,</i>

638
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:07,827
<i>not only so that you may
know him better,</i>

639
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:12,264
<i>but walk more closely
in his footsteps.</i>

640
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:16,301
<i>Your devoted husband,
Nelson."</i>

641
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,407
Nucky.

642
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:57,443
Oh my God.

643
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,379
Everything's going to be fine.

644
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,582
It might take awhile,

645
00:47:03,617 --> 00:47:06,018
but we'll get him
back on his feet.

646
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:08,487
Give us a minute, will you?

647
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:24,836
How are you doing,
little brother?

648
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:28,874
They came out of nowhere.

649
00:47:31,177 --> 00:47:33,111
Nothing I could do.

650
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:41,086
It's only money, forget it.

651
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:44,322
It's more than money.

652
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:48,859
We're under siege.

653
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:55,933
I asked Jimmy to come back.

654
00:47:57,035 --> 00:47:58,970
Jimmy?

655
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,939
We need help, Eli.

656
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,714
How many years
have we been doing this?

657
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:13,217
Not once has this
ever happened.

658
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:18,856
It's a new world.

659
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:37,634
